This folder contains three subfolders:

- Constant_Time_HQC: this is the original source code from the HQC team;
- Constant-Time_AVX_FC: this is our source code for the fast convolution mumultiplication;
- Constant-Time_AVX_Rand_FC: this is our source code for the randomized fast convolution mumultiplication;

To launch the experimientation, please type:

    $ cd Constant_Time_HQC/
    $ ./all.sh
    $ cd ../Constant_time_AVX_FC/
    $ ./all.sh
    $ cd ../Constant_time_Rand_AVX_FC/
    $ ./all.sh
